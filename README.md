# ExplorerPosition
Sneaky little program to monitor newly opening Explorer.exe windows in order to re-position them to the monitor where the mouse cursor is currently residing.

Program doesn't really have configuration options, though in code `positionUnderCursor` can be set to false in order for the program to not do any repositioning beyond moving the window to same relative coordinates on another monitor.
